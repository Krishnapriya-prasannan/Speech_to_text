##  Day 4 - AI for Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text using Whisper)

This is part of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge. On Day 4, I learnt to use [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) â€” a general-purpose speech recognition model â€” to convert spoken audio into written text.

### **Goal**
Convert audio (.wav) files to text using an AI-powered offline speech recognition system.

### **Technologies Used**

| Tool         | Purpose                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Python       | Main programming language                      |
| Whisper      | Offline speech-to-text model from OpenAI       |
| VS Code      | Code editor                                    |

### ðŸš€ **How It Works**
1. Load the Whisper model (`base` model used for a balance of speed and accuracy).
2. Read and transcribe the `.wav` audio file.
3. Print and save the transcribed text.
